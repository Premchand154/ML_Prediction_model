# Wine Quality Prediction üç∑

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict the quality of wine based on physicochemical tests (like acidity, sugar content, alcohol percentage, etc.). The goal is to classify wine samples as either good or bad based on the given features.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Wine Quality dataset, commonly available on UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Features include:
- Fixed acidity
- Volatile acidity
- Citric acid
- Residual sugar
- Chlorides
- Free sulfur dioxide
- Total sulfur dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol
- Quality (target)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Other ML models

## Steps
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Model Training
4. Model Evaluation
5. Final Prediction

## How to Run
- Clone the repository.
- Install the requirements using:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

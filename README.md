# Wine Quality Prediction üç∑

## Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict the quality of wine based on physicochemical tests (like acidity, sugar content, alcohol percentage, etc.).
The goal is to classify wine samples as either good or bad based on these features to assist in quality control processes.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the Wine Quality dataset (specifically **White Wine**), commonly available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Included locally as: **`WhiteWineQuality.csv`**

**Features include:**

* Fixed acidity
* Volatile acidity
* Citric acid
* Residual sugar
* Chlorides
* Free sulfur dioxide
* Total sulfur dioxide
* Density
* pH
* Sulphates
* Alcohol
* Quality (target)

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

## Models Implemented

* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest Classifier
* Decision Tree Classifier
* (Other models for comparison)

## Project Workflow

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building
5. Model Evaluation and Prediction
